            <h3>Go to the Beach</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    San Diego has no shortage of incredible beaches — which can make it nearly impossible to pick just
                    one or two to see during a trip to this West Coast city. But the top beaches in San Diego stand out
                    because they're so much more than attractive stretches of coastline.

                <p>
                    With some of the best weather, food, schools, and beaches in the world, San Diego is one of the best
                    places to live in the entire country. Known for its high quality of life and relaxed atmosphere,
                    living in San Diego is often considered better than living in Los Angeles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    San Diego's downtown is a vibrant place to be, with lots of fun things to do, eat and explore. It's
                    also a great hub if you're on the market for an apartment in San Diego, as it doesn't get more
                    central than San Diego's downtown

                <p>A fort and mission were established in 1769, which gradually expanded into a settlement under first
                    Spanish and then Mexican rule. San Diego officially became part of the U.S. in 1848, and the town
                    was named the county seat of San Diego County when California was granted statehood in 1850. It
                    remained a very small town for several decades, but grew rapidly after 1880 due to development and
                    the establishment of multiple military facilities. Growth was especially rapid during and
                    immediately after World War II. Entrepreneurs and boosters laid the basis for an economy based today
                    on the military, defense industries, biotech, tourism, international trade, and manufacturing. San
                    Diego is now the eighth largest city in the country and forms the heart of the larger San Diego
                    metropolitan area.</p>

                <p>While living in San Diego can carry a higher cost of living, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to
                    live affordably in one of the best West Coast cities! In fact, living in San Diego is more
                    affordable than in other large metros like New York or San Francisco. If you’re planning on renting
                    in the City of Motion, you can expect to spend around $1,427, while San Diegans looking to buy a
                    home spend an average of $488,600. Whether you buy or rent a home in San Diego, you can find more
                    savings by living in inexpensive neighborhoods in San Diego, like Rancho Bernardo or Scripps Ranch.
                    Or, if you’re being stationed in San Diego, Naval Base Coronado is perfect for military families.

                <p>The culture of San Diego, California is influenced heavily by American and Mexican cultures due to
                    its position as a border town, its large Hispanic population, and its history as part of Spanish
                    America and Mexico. San Diego's longtime association with the U.S. military also contributes to its
                    culture. Present-day culture includes many historical and tourist attractions, a thriving musical
                    and theatrical scene, numerous notable special events, a varied cuisine, and a reputation as one of
                    America's premier centers of craft brewing.</p>
                <p>Tourism has affected the city's culture, as San Diego houses many tourist attractions, such as
                    SeaWorld, Aquatica San Diego, the San Diego Zoo, San Diego Wild Animal Park, Belmont Park, Balboa
                    Park, and nearby Legoland. San Diego's Spanish influence can be seen in the many historic sites
                    across the city, such as the Mission San Diego de Alcala, Old Town San Diego State Historic Park,
                    and Balboa Park. Cuisine in San Diego is diverse, but there is an abundance of wood fired
                    California-style pizzas, and Mexican and East Asian cuisine. Annual events in San Diego include
                    Comic-Con, the San Diego/Del Mar Fair, San Diego Pride, and Street Scene Music Festival.</p>
